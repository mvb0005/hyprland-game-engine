# Copilot Instructions

This repository follows a specification-driven development workflow.

## Workflow

1.  **Feature Branches**: All changes happen on feature branches.
2.  **Specification First**: Changes start with modifying or creating a file in `specs/`.
3.  **Test Driven**: Create failing tests that validate the specification before implementing changes.
4.  **Implementation**: Implement the changes to make the tests pass.

## Repository Structure

- `specs/`: Contains system specifications and prompts.
- `docs/`: Human-readable documentation.
- `tests/`: Test suites.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts.
- `boggle/`: Boggle game source.
- `lexigraph/`: Lexigraph source.
